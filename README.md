# NODEJS RESTful-API server

Just to setup the PostgreSQL, React, and Express/NodeJs boilerplate to off ground faster

## How to get started

1. Simply clone/download or folk this repository and just open it with your favolite editor.
2. make sure you have the node enviroment installed on your computer, or follow `https://nodejs.org/en/download/` to install it. it is recommended to install the LTS version. or you can install the latest if you want to play around with its new features.
3. check whether you have a complete node environment installed using the following commands:
   1. `node -v` to check your node environment version
   2. `npm -v` to check your node package manager version
      The node installation comes with npm(node package manager) by default, but you can choose either yarn `https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/` if you prefer.
4. After all, open your project folder location in a terminal and type one of the following commands:

### i. yarn install (if you are using `yarn` as your package manager) or

### ii. npm install (if you are using `npm` as your package manager)

## How can I start the server locally and play around with it on my own (?)

After getting the environment set up, you can open the project location in your terminal and then type the command to start the server `yarn start` or `npm run server`, you'll see the logs telling you the `port` on which your server is using or throws an error if any.

## How can I contribute or build my own from this code(?)

Yes you can use this node server boilerplate to build your own. Once cloned/downloaded or folked, feel free to open any of the files contained in either folders and start building without working around with the setup configurations cuz it's all set.

Or if you want to contribute to this repo, please pull the request to build the goodness of this boilerplate together.
